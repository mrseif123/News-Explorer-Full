# Practicum100 Web Development Bootcamp Final Project.

- Part of the [Practicum by Yandex](https://practicum.yandex.com/) Web Development Bootcamp Curriculum.

A responsive website using HTML5, CSS3 (flexbox, grid, BEM), JavaScript, built following the design mokup in Figma.
This adaptive page includes form validation, interactive popups, fade-in and fade-out animations, functional like and delete buttons, modular JavaScript, and Object Oriented JS design.

The React Framework is used to add functionality to Form Fields in a Popup Box and save the edited values. Used BEM methodology with a nested file structure.

The server-side web framework Express.js is used to help deploy our own back-end server faster, work with databases, set up security and testing, as well as deploying the back end on a remote machine. The goal of all this is to create a server with an API and user authentication.

The project interactivity includes:

- Popup modals for: Updating profile info and avatar image, Adding new cards and Deleting user's owncards only
- Liking and unliking cards
- Sign up and Sign in

The current version is responsive gets profile information and images via API, and has functioning modal popups.
The project adapts to the width of various devices (from 320px to 1280px). The project is based on dynamically editing the profile information on popup modals and adding cards of places and image popups. Everything is rendering responsively adapting to different screen sizes.

**Features**

- Form Popup Modal: editing profile information, adding/deleting cards with images and titles unsing a link to photo and Forms are validated using javascript. Image popup for each card with Delete and Like button.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
